# Teaching and mentoring

  * In each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, student evaluations for "Applied forecasting for business and economics" gave an average rating for my teaching above 4.8 out of 5, while all students in 2018 rated "Advanced statistical modelling" at 5 out of 5. (I did not teach the latter subject in 2019 and 2020.)
  * I currently supervise five PhD students and two post-doctoral research fellows. I have previously supervised another 27 PhD students and 3 Masters students.
  * I am author of an innovative textbook with George Athanasopoulos entitled *Forecasting: principles and practice* ([`OTexts.org/fpp2/`](https://OTexts.org/fpp2)) which is available online and free of charge. The website has an average of over 20000 pageviews per day.
  * I publish the [*Hyndsight*](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight) blog on research issues which receives an average of about 2000 pageviews per day.

```

I have coauthored `r length(rjhpkgs)` R packages in addition to my other research outputs. These provide implementations of many of my methodological research contributions and allow the translation of my research into practice. There have been `r round(sum(since2015$count)/1e6)` million downloads of my packages since 2015 (to 30 July 2020). The most downloaded packages for which I am the primary author are listed below.\vspace*{0.3cm}

```{r}
since2015 %>%
  group_by(package) %>%
  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(!(package %in% c("rmarkdown", "fracdiff", "DescTools", "tsibble"))) %>%
  filter(count > 1e5) %>%
  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
  mutate(count = scales::comma(count)) %>%

    booktabs = TRUE,
    col.names = c("Package", "Downloads since 2015"),
