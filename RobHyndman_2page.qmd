# R packages

I have coauthored `r NROW(rjh_packages)` R packages as a result of my research. There have been over `r round(sum(rjh_packages$downloads, na.rm=TRUE)/1e6)` million downloads of my packages since 2015 (to `r format(Sys.time(), "%e %B %Y")`).

# Selected papers

Since 1991 I have authored `r npapers` research papers or book chapters on statistical topics. Some highlights are listed below, with citations taken from Google Scholar on `r format(Sys.time(), "%e %B %Y")`.  My h-index is `r rjh$All[2]` with total citations of `r prettyNum(rjh$All[1], big.mark=",")`.
